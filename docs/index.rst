Welcome to Funannotate2's documentation!
=======================================

Funannotate2 is a comprehensive eukaryotic genome annotation pipeline that provides a complete workflow for annotating fungal, plant, and other eukaryotic genomes. It integrates various tools and databases to produce high-quality gene predictions and functional annotations.

Key Features
-----------

* Genome cleaning and preparation
* Gene prediction using multiple methods (Augustus, GeneMark-ES, SNAP, GlimmerHMM, etc.)
* Automated ab-initio training of gene prediction algorithms
* Evidence-based gene prediction using transcript andd protein alignment evidence
* Functional annotation using various databases (Pfam, dbCAN, MEROPS, SwissProt, etc.)
* BUSCO-based quality assessment
* Output in various formats (GFF3, GenBank, FASTA, etc.)
